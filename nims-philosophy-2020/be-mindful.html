						Our life &mdash; or at least our conscious experience &mdash; is really just one long train of thought.
						And we need to learn to steer the tracks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Put another way, the number of thoughts you will have from this very instant until the day you die is <em>finite</em>.
						This finite set of thoughts basically paints the remainder of the experience you call "life".
						Hence, it's vital to regularly pause your thinking and pick and choose <em>exactly</em> what thoughts to have.
						In other words, it's important to be <em>mindful</em>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many topics of thought are simply useless, and will not bring any positive changes to your life or the life of others.
						For instance, thinking about an embarrassing moment from the past, or a family problem you aren't willing to solve will not bring anyone any good.
						But thinking about a positive memory or about the next steps of a personal project will.

					<h2>What is this page?</h2>
					<p>
						The idea I've presented above is one of 6 ideas that drove me in 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Good ideas are everywhere, but they are useless unless we regularly re-expose ourselves to them.
						Hence, in 2020, I made a habit of re-exposing myself to the following ideas:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="be-mindful.html">Be Mindful</a></li>
						<li><a href="moderate-info-consumption.html">Moderate Info Consumption</a></li>
						<li><a href="anger-is-mostly-useless.html">Anger Is Mostly Useless</a></li>
						<li><a href="plan-your-ego-depletion.html">Plan Your Ego Depletion</a></li>
						<li><a href="list-positives.html">List Positives</a></li>
						<li><a href="love-family.html">Love + Family</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I simply journaled these ideas on 41 different days.
						This habit made it easier for me to execute the 6 ideas, albeit imperfectly, in my daily decisions.
						I highly recommend that you do the same â€” with your own set of ideas of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please know that I am completely open to changing my mind about these ideas, and that I likely will in the future.
						If you'd like to share anything with me, please feel free to reach out on Twitter, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/IAmNimJay">@IAmNimJay</a>. ðŸ˜Š
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks for stopping by.
