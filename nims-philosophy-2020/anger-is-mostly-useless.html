						I think the most important philosophical discovery one can make in life is that humans either have very little free will or none at all.
						Every decision you make in life is influenced by nature (your biology and the hardwiring of your brain) and nurture (the people around you and information you're exposed to through mediums such as Twitter).
					</p>
					<p>
						If you were born to Jewish parents in Israel, you would likely practice Judaism for a chunk of your life.
						If you choose to eat fruit instead of chocolate, it's likely because of the advice and education you received from others.
						Your actions are based on environmentally-influenced and biologically-driven desires and beliefs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some neuroscience discoveries might even convince you that free will is an illusion; however, that can be an intimidating discussion so let's save it for later.
					</p>
					<p>
						The point is that people either have very little or no control of their actions.
						So when someone's actions anger you, remember that they had little or no control, and try to solve the anger-invoking issue <em>without</em> the anger.
					</p>
					<p>
						Anger is just an emotional response to a problem that can be solved &mdash; often, more productively &mdash; without anger.
						It can help us identify problems and their significance, but beyond that, anger is mostly useless.
					</p>
					<p>
						So I encourage you to always make an attempt to dismiss anger as soon as it has helped you identify the problem at hand, which is usually immediately.
						It's easier said than done, of course, so don't feel bad if you fail.

					<h2>What is this page?</h2>
					<p>
						The idea I've presented above is one of 6 ideas that drove me in 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Good ideas are everywhere, but they are useless unless we regularly re-expose ourselves to them.
						Hence, in 2020, I made a habit of re-exposing myself to the following ideas:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="be-mindful.html">Be Mindful</a></li>
						<li><a href="moderate-info-consumption.html">Moderate Info Consumption</a></li>
						<li><a href="anger-is-mostly-useless.html">Anger Is Mostly Useless</a></li>
						<li><a href="plan-your-ego-depletion.html">Plan Your Ego Depletion</a></li>
						<li><a href="list-positives.html">List Positives</a></li>
						<li><a href="love-family.html">Love + Family</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I simply journaled these ideas on 41 different days.
						This habit made it easier for me to execute the 6 ideas, albeit imperfectly, in my daily decisions.
						I highly recommend that you do the same â€” with your own set of ideas of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please know that I am completely open to changing my mind about these ideas, and that I likely will in the future.
						If you'd like to share anything with me, please feel free to reach out on Twitter, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/IAmNimJay">@IAmNimJay</a>. ðŸ˜Š
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks for stopping by.
