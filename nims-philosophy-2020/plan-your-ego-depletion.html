						When you wake up to begin your day, you have a limited amount of mental resources to use throughout the day.
						And every decision you make, from choosing your outfit to rewording your emails drain ("depletes") this mental resource ("ego").
						This is known as ego depletion.
						This mental energy is also used up every time you exercise your self-control and willpower.
					</p>
					<p>
						We operate similar to a battery.
						But unlike a battery which performs consistently until it reaches 0%, our mental <em>performance</em> itself also depletes throughout the day.
						In other words, the earlier it is in the day, the better suited you are for tasks that require a lot of thinking and willpower.
					</p>
					<p>
						So it's important to plan your day accordingly and ask yourself how you want your daily ego to deplete.
						Understand that you can only achieve so much in a day and that tasks that require more cognition and willpower should be addressed early.

					<h2>What is this page?</h2>
					<p>
						The idea I've presented above is one of 6 ideas that drove me in 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Good ideas are everywhere, but they are useless unless we regularly re-expose ourselves to them.
						Hence, in 2020, I made a habit of re-exposing myself to the following ideas:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="be-mindful.html">Be Mindful</a></li>
						<li><a href="moderate-info-consumption.html">Moderate Info Consumption</a></li>
						<li><a href="anger-is-mostly-useless.html">Anger Is Mostly Useless</a></li>
						<li><a href="plan-your-ego-depletion.html">Plan Your Ego Depletion</a></li>
						<li><a href="list-positives.html">List Positives</a></li>
						<li><a href="love-family.html">Love + Family</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I simply journaled these ideas on 41 different days.
						This habit made it easier for me to execute the 6 ideas, albeit imperfectly, in my daily decisions.
						I highly recommend that you do the same â€” with your own set of ideas of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please know that I am completely open to changing my mind about these ideas, and that I likely will in the future.
						If you'd like to share anything with me, please feel free to reach out on Twitter, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/IAmNimJay">@IAmNimJay</a>. ðŸ˜Š
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks for stopping by.
