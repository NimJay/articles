					<p>
						We live in an "attention economy".
						This means that businesses are not only completing for what's in your wallet, but they're also competing for your attention.
						And they do so by constantly serving you new content (e.g., more news articles and new TV series).
					<p>
						What's worse is that our brains love novelty, so new ideas are some times more attractive to us than familiar ideas.
						For instance, a YouTube video you have never yet watched will appear more attractive than one you <em>have</em> already watched.
						As a consequence, you might find yourself consuming more information than you can mentally digest and make useful.
					</p>
					<p>
						The truth is that you and I have already been exposed to some extremely useful ideas.
						What we really need to do is stick to those ideas, re-expose ourselves to them, and execute.
						Drive your life with the good ideas that you're already familiar with.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moreover, it's useful to moderate the amount of new ideas you consume.
						It really doesn't hurt to consume less.

					<h2>What is this page?</h2>
					<p>
						The idea I've presented above is one of the 6 ideas that drove me in 2020.
					</p>
					<p>
						Good ideas are everywhere, but they are useless unless we regularly re-expose ourselves to them.
						Hence, in 2020, I made a habit of re-exposing myself to the following ideas:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="be-mindful.html">Be Mindful</a></li>
						<li><a href="moderate-info-consumption.html">Moderate Info Consumption</a></li>
						<li><a href="anger-is-mostly-useless.html">Anger Is Mostly Useless</a></li>
						<li><a href="plan-your-ego-depletion.html">Plan Your Ego Depletion</a></li>
						<li><a href="list-positives.html">List Positives</a></li>
						<li><a href="love-family.html">Love + Family</a></li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I simply journaled these ideas on 41 different days.
						This habit made it easier for me to execute the 6 ideas, albeit imperfectly, in my daily decisions.
						I highly recommend that you do the same â€” with your own set of ideas of course.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please know that I am completely open to changing my mind about these ideas, and that I likely will in the future.
						If you'd like to share anything with me, please feel free to reach out on Twitter, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/IAmNimJay">@IAmNimJay</a>. ðŸ˜Š
					</p>
					<p>
						Thanks for stopping by.
